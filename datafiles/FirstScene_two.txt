[EX_hhh]text_flag_high_fiveYou slap her hand, making sure to look at her elbow while you do so. It makes a good SLAP
[EX_hhh]text_flag_high_fiveYour hand stings as you look back up at her. Maybe she wanted to test your hand-eye coordination?
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hand_shakeYou cordially grip her hand, making sure to be firm but not too firm. Just like father taught you.
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hand_shakeMaybe she wanted to see how cultured you were?
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hugYou pull her in, wrapping your left arm around her back before patting her lightly on the shoulder.
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hugMaybe she wanted to see if you were a warm person?
{Scene change to girl looking disgusted}
Girl: "Eww, no Penischamp! I would never go to prom with you. Why'd you even ask me, anyway, we hardly even know each other? 
Get away from me, you pervert!"
She throws her pack of cigarettes at you. You reflexively reach your hand up to catch it.
PC: "Oh. Sorry!" You quickly walk back to where Lila's been standing, watching this whole time.
[Stupid. Why'd you even let Lila talk you into doing something like this anyway?]
{Scene change back to talking to Lila}
Lila: "So? What'd she say?"
PC: "She said no, just like I said she would. Why'd you even make me humiliate myself, anyway?"
Lila: "She said no? But didn't you give her what she wanted?"
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hugPC: "I gave her a hug, if that's what you mean."
[EX_hhh]text_flag_high_fivePC: "I gave her a high five, if that's what you mean."
[EX_hhh]text_flag_hand_shakePC: "I gave her a hand shake, if that's what you mean."
Lila: "[Anime grunt] You gave her what? Baka Penischamp, everyone knows that girl wants a BionicleÂ®!"
PC: "Well I didn't know that! Besides, how would that have even changed anything?"
Lila: "[Sighs] PenisChamp, everyone at Inspire wants something. If you give it to them, they'll go to prom with you!"
PC: "Like they have to go to prom with you?"
Lila: "No, of course not, baka. But they won't go to prom with you unless you give them their item, no matter how badly they might want to otherwise."
PC: "Isn't that kind of materialistic?"
Lila: "I don't make the rules, PenisChamp. Besides, how did you not know this? Haven't you been going here for months now?"
PC: "Yeah, but you know I'm a slow learner. It somehow still feels like it's the first day."
Lila: "Useless. Hey, what are you holding there?"
[She takes the pack of cigarettes out of your hand, looks at it, then smiles wide.]
Lila: "So you did know!"
PC: "Know what?"
Lila: "About the items!"
PC: "No, I told you I didn't."
Lila: "Stop playing dumb!"
PC: "I'm not playing dumb, I am dumb. And right now I feel more dumb than ever."
Lila: "Ugh, fine, I'll go to prom with you, baka. I don't know why you're being so weird about it."
PC: "What?! When did I ask you to prom?"
Lila: "Just now, when you gave me my item."
[You look down, and see that it's a pack of Camels.]
{Scene change to Camels}
PC: "I didn't know that was--"
Lila: "Stop making such a big deal out of it, dummy. It's not like I want to go with you or anything, but I don't have a date either. We're just going as friends, anyways."
PC: "You didn't have a prom date? Why didn't you just say so, instead of making me embarrass myself in front of that girl?"
Lila: "Baka, have you been paying attention at all? I couldn't go with you because you didn't have my item!"
PC: "So... you couldn't go with me... because I hadn't given you a pack of cigarettes?"
Lila: "My item!"
PC: "No matter how bad you wanted me to go with you?"
Lila: "Now you're getting it!"
PC: "So you wanted to go to prom with me this whole time?"
{Scene change to Lila blushing}
[Lila blushes]
Lila: "No, I--I didn't want to go to prom with you, I just didn't want to go alone! Hentai baka, why do you always have to make things weird?"
PC: "You're the one who made things weird by making me ask that girl out! Besides, how was I even supposed to know what your item was?"
Lila: "Because you've gotten to know me over the years, and know that I've always loved Camels."
PC: "Then... how'd you expect me to get these, even? We're not old enough to buy cigarettes at the store."
Lila: "By asking that girl out!"
PC: "What?"
{Scene change to Lila smiling}
Lila: "Well, I figured if you got rejected by her, she'd get mad and throw those at you."
PC: "How did you know she'd do something random like that?! Are you psychic or something?"
[Lila WeirdChamps you]
Lila: "People at Inspire always give you an item if they reject you! Geez, don't you know anything?"
PC: "Apparently not. Wait, so the only way I could have gotten an item to ask you out... is by getting turned down by someone else?"
Lila: "Well, sometimes you'll be the one turning them down."
PC: "What?"
Lila: "Nevermind. Yes, you need to be rejected by someone in order to get an item to ask someone else out."
PC: "But how do I know who wants that item?"
Lila: "By getting to know them!"
PC: "So I would have had to get to know everyone at the school to figure out whose item that was?"
Lila: "Well, people who have each other's items tend to know each other. That's why they have something that's so important to that other person!"
PC: "Geez, that seems like kind of a complicated process for getting a date. I'm glad I don't have to deal with that anymore, now that we're going together."
[Lila laughs uncomfortably]
Lila: "Just as friends, remember."
PC: "Wait, but does that mean you have that girl's lighter?"
Lila: "Yep! Any other questions?"
