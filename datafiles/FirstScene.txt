BACKGROUND_FLAG[player-bedroom]???: “Come on,GET UP, baka! You’re going to make me late for school!” [SHAKE]
You wake up to a girl standing over you. 
Startled, you blink sleep from your eyes, her face slowly coming into focus.  She looks angry.
???: “Are you deaf, PenisChamp? I said GET UP!” [SHAKE]BARK_LilaGetUp_3rd_EDITED__BARK
Very angry. You squint, trying to make out her features.
???: “PenisChamp, please. PLEASE don’t make us late again. It’s the fifth time this month!”
She’s starting to sound desperate now.BARK_LilaGetUp_3rd_EDITED__BARK
Wait a minute. You know that voice. It’s the voice of--
PC: “Lila? What are you doing in my room?” 
Lila is one of my closest friends, but it’s still weird for her to be in here. Especially since... 
Lila: “Your mom let me in, dummy. What’re you waiting for? GET UP!”
PC: “But, Lila--I’m not wearing any...” 
You feel your face heat up. 
Lila: “Penischamp? Are you nak--Naked?!” 
Her eyes go wide at the revelation. 
Lila: “You pervert!”
PC: “What? How am I a pervert?”
Lila: “Only perverts sleep naked, everyone knows that. I bet you wanted me to walk in on you, hentai baka.”
PC: “Well...Well you’re the one who was watching me sleep!”
Now it’s Lila’s turn to blush.
Lila: “Baka! It’s not like I wanted to see you sleeping. You weren’t getting up when I knocked. I had to come wake you, or-- Nevermind, just get dressed.  We’re gonna be late!”
Lila walks out of your room, slamming the door behind her. You hastily put on clothes, brush your teeth, and grab your backpack before taking the stairs two at a time to meet Lila at the front door.
BACKGROUND_FLAG[front-door]Lila: “Finally! What took you so long?”
PC: “I was--”
Lila: “That was rhetorical, dummy. Let’s go, or we’re gonna get detention!”
{Scene change to Lila walking with toast in her mouth}
BACKGROUND_FLAG[cherry-trees]It’s a beautiful spring morning. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and there’s not a cloud in the sky. The sidewalk is more empty than usual, only a few late students who jog past you and Lila. 
As much as Lila hates being late, she hates running even more, so you walk at a brisk, but reasonable, pace. You’re sleepy at first, but the morning air wakes you up after a minute.
It’s a beautiful day, and, to top it all off, you notice that the cherry blossoms are starting to bloom.
{Scene change to talking to Lila}
PC: “The cherry blossoms are starting to bloom.”
Lila: “Yeah, didn’t you notice last week?”
PC: “No, I--I guess I didn’t.”
Lila: “Baka. You’re so dense, you probably wouldn’t notice if something hit you in the head.” 
PC: “Hey! That’s not very nice.”
Lila: “But it is very true. Anyway, are you thinking about taking anybody to go see the cherry blossoms?” 
She tries to hide her smirk when she says it. 
PC: “I can’t even get someone to go to prom with me, let alone something like that.” Lila looks shocked.
Lila: “What? You don’t have a prom date? It’s in a week, baka!”
PC: “I know, I know. It’s just-- You know, I just transferred to Inspire this term, and I hardly know anyone, so--”
Lila: “So you’re just okay with going alone? That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard, PenisChamp.”
PC: “No, I probably just won’t go. I don’t really care about prom, anyway.”
Lila: “What?!?! PenisChamp, you have to go to prom! Everyone goes to prom!” [SHAKE]
PC: “But you just said it’d be sad if I went without a date!”
Lila: “It’d be even sadder if you didn’t go at all!”
PC: “But I don’t want to go alone, it’d be so embarassing!”
Lila: “Then ask someone to go to prom with you, baka.”
PC: “I don’t even know who to ask. And besides, whoever I did ask probably wouldn’t agree to go with me.”
Lila: “They would if you give them what they want!”
PC: “...”
PC: “What?”
Lila: “They’ll go with you if you just give them what they want!”
PC: “No, I heard you, just... What does that even mean?”
Lila: “You really are clueless, aren’t you? See that girl walking ahead of us? The one holding the pack of cigarettes?”
PC: “Yeah, what about her?”
Lila: “Ask her to go to prom with you!”
PC: “What? No, I couldn’t!”
Lila: “You have to! You can’t go to prom alone.”
PC: “But what if she says no?”
Lila: “She won’t say no if you give her what she wants!”
Lila: “Now go! We’re almost at school!”
Lila practically pushes you up to the girl with the cigarettes. In the brief moment before you greet her, you wonder what it is this girl could possibly want.
{Scene change to talking to generic anime girl}
PC: “Uh, hi, My friend back there wanted me to talk to you.”
Girl: “Oh, hi! You’re PenisChamp, right?”
PC: “Yeah! Uh, I just--Would you--Uh--Do you...” 
PC: “I wanted to-- to ask if you’d go to prom with me?” 
Your voice cracks as you say it.
The girl stops suddenly, a blank expression on her face. You look down and realize she’s holding out her right hand.
