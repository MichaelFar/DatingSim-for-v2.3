BACKGROUND_FLAG[player-bedroom]???: "Come on, GET UP, baka! You're going to make me late for school!"
[You wake up to a girl standing over you. Startled, you blink sleep from your eyes, the girl's face slowly coming into focus.  She looks angry.]
???: "Are you deaf, PenisChamp? I said GET UP!"
[Very angry. You squint, trying to make out her features.]
???: "PenisChamp, please. PLEASE don't make us late again. Not today of all days" She's starting to sound desperate now
[Wait a minute. You know that voice. It's the voice of--]
PC: "Lila? What are you doing in my room?" Lila is one of my closest friends, but it's still weird for her to be in my room.
Lila: "Your mom let me in, baka."
PC: "But, Lila--I'm not wearing any..." You feel your face heat up. 
Lila: "PenisChamp? Are you nak--" Her eyes go wide at the revelation. "Pervert!"
PC: "What? How am I the pervert? You're the one who walked in on me sleeping!" Now it's Lila's turn to blush.
Lila: "Baka! It's not like I wanted to see you sleeping. You weren't getting up when I knocked. I had to come in. Now get dressed, we're gonna be late!"
[Lila walks out of your room, slamming the door behind her. You hastily put on clothes, brush your teeth, and grab your backpack before taking the stairs two at a time to meet Lila at the front door]

Lila: "Finally! What took you so long?"
PC: "I was--"
Lila: "Nevermind! Let's go, or we're going to have to run to make it on time."
{Scene change to Lila walking with toast in her mouth}
[It's a beautiful spring morning.]
BACKGROUND_FLAG[cherry-trees]PC: "The cherry blossoms are blooming."
Lila: "Yeah, didn't you notice last week?"
PC: "No, I--I guess I didn't."
Lila: "Baka. You're so dense, you wouldn't notice if something hit you in the head"
PC: "Hey! That's not very nice."
Lila: "But it is very true. Anyway, are you thinking about taking any girls to go see the cherry blossoms?" She's kind of laughing when she says it.
PC: "I can't even get a girl to go to prom with me, let alone something like that."
Lila: "What? You don't have a prom date? It's in a week, baka!"
PC: "I know, I know. It's just-- You know, I just transferred to Inspire this term, and I hardly know anyone."
Lila: "So you're just going to go alone? That's so sad, PenisChamp."
PC: "No, I probably just won't go. I don't really care about prom, anyway."
Lila: "What?!?! PenisChamp, you have to go to prom! Everyone goes to prom!"
PC: "But you just said it'd be sad if I went without a date!"
Lila: "Then ask someone, baka."
PC: "I don't even know who to ask. And besides, whoever I did ask probably wouldn't agree to go with me."
Lila: "They would if you give them what they want!"
PC: "What does that even mean?"
Lila: "You really are clueless, aren't you? See that girl walking ahead of us? The one holding the pack of cigarettes?"
PC: "Yeah, what about her?"
Lila: "Ask her to go to prom with you!"
PC: "What? No, I couldn't!"
Lila: "You have to! You can't go to prom alone, baka."
PC: "But what if she says no?"
Lila: "She won't say no if you give her what she wants! Now go! We're almost at school!"
[Lila practically pushes you up to her. In the brief moments before you reach her side, you wonder what it is this girl could possibly want]
{Scene change to talking to generic anime girl}
PC: "Uh, hi, My friend back there wanted me to talk to you."
Girl: "Oh, hi! You're PenisChamp, right?"
PC: "Yeah! Uh, I just--I wanted to ask if you'd go to prom with me?" Your voice cracks as she says it.
[The girl stops suddenly, a blank expression on her face. You look down and realize she's holding out her right hand.]
