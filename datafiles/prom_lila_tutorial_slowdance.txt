PC: "How do we--?"
Lila: "Ugh, you're hopeless! Just take this hand--No, not that one, obviously, your other hand, Baka! 
Lila: God, haven't you ever seen a movie PenisChamp?"
PC: "Of course I have, I'm just--I'm nervous, that's all."
Lila: "Well, don't be. What do you have to be nervous about?"
PC: "I don't know. I'm just... not used to this sort of thing, that's all."
Lila: "Get used to it! We're dancing. Put this hand--right here, on my waist, and I put my hand on your shoulder, like this. Now, just hold my hand kinda like this--no, don't squeeze, just let it sit there. 
Lila: No, not totally limp, just gentle, like--Yes, there you go. Was that so hard?"
PC: "Yes."
Lila: "Ugh. Just... shut up and dance."
[You and Lila awkwardly sway to the music for a few seconds]
PC: "So..."
Lila: "Gosh, PenisChamp-baka, haven't you ever talked to a girl before?"
PC: "Not like this, I haven't."
Lila: "All you have to do is say something."
