Lila: "What are you doing PenisChamp?" 
PC: "I--I thought you wanted me to--"
Lila: "No, PenisChamp, you moron. I meant we could go out for ice cream or something. Why would you think I wanted you to kiss me?"
PC: "I--I'm sorry, I--"
Lila: "You're sorry? You're sorry?! We've been friends our whole lives, PenisChamp, and you just decide to throw it away like that?"
PC: "I--"
Lila: "Why would you do something so stupid, PenisChamp. I mean, wake up! Look around you!"
PC: "Lila, if you just let me--"
Lila: "Stupid, stupid, stupid. Wake up PenisChamp!"
PC: "Stop telling me to wake up!"
Lila: "No. I mean, wake up, PenisChamp." 
Her voice is blank this time when she says it. 
Lila: "Wake up."
