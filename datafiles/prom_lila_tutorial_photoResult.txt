[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyLila: "Wow! We both look like we're having so much fun!"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyPC: "We really do. Hey, were you giving me bunny ears!"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyLila: "I knew you wouldn't notice â€˜til it was too late, PenisChamp-baka."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyPC: "Ugh, now our kids will know I'm clueless."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyLila: "I think they would have figured it out anyway." 
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_silly[Lila realizes what she's said]
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyLila: "Not that we're going to have kids, baka!" 
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyYou laugh.
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_silly[Lila hits you]
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyPC: "Ow! What was that for?"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_sillyLila: "You know exactly what that was for. Now come on, let's do something else before I hit you again."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousLila: "Wow. We look so formal. Like grown ups."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousPC: "Well, I figured since we're gonna have these for the rest of our lives, we might as well look our best."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousLila: "Is your best really that scowl? You look like you're about to hurt someone, PenisChamp!"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousPC: "It's not that bad, is it?"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousLila: "No, no, of course not. Just... don't show that to your kids until they're old enough."
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousPC: "Old enough?"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousLila: "Well, you wouldn't want them to find out their parent is a serial killer when they're a toddler, would you?"
[TUTPHOTO]text_flag_seriousPC: "Okay, I get it. Let's move on."
